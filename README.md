# Steps of the exercise
1. Control the LED lighting
    - Switching Led to pwm
    - Programming the lighting depending on the fill factor
      - fill: 0..100: 1 -> barely lit, 100 -> fully lit 
2. Change the current 
  Plot on the screen the change in current as you turn the potentiometer
  - Determine the minimum and maximum current
  - We normalize this current variation between 0 and 100
  - The normalized variation is converted to the fill
  - We operate the LED
3. displaying the fill factor on the seven-segment display
